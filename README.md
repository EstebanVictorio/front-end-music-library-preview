### Front-End Library by a non-premium account.

This application currently does not offer audio playback, since this service is an audio-only restriction.
Further implementation may be able through negotiations with Spotify according to their 
license, content, branding and use terms of use & service guidelines, as well as their
legal notices.

All credits of the API goes to Spotify and their agreements to their respective content-artist agreements.
