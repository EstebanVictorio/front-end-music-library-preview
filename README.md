# front-end-music-library-preview
A music library preview for Front-End using Spotify Web API.

### Front-End Library by a non-premium account.

This application currently does not offer audio playback, since this service is an audio-only restriction to Spotify's Premium Service Accounts.
Further implementation may be able through negotiations with Spotify according to their 
license, content, branding and use terms of use & service guidelines, as well as their
legal notices.

All credits of the API goes to Spotify and their agreements to their respective content-artist agreements.

Any questions that you may have are welcome and I'll try to answer as best as I can regarding the implementation.

##### NOTE: Images and URL resources are property of their respective owners on Spotify Platform & content artists.
##### Hereby, I do not own and by no means claim to own any of the artwork, names, artist names and resources provided by the Spotify's Web API. Any further modifications must be done within the range of permissions according to the Spotify's terms of service, licensing, privacy policy and branding guidelines.
