# front-end-music-library-preview
A music library preview for Front-End using Spotify Web API.

### Front-End Library by a non-premium account.

This application currently does not offer audio playback, since this service is an audio-only restriction to Spotify's Premium Service Accounts.
Further implementation may be able through negotiations with Spotify according to their 
license, content, branding and use terms of use & service guidelines, as well as their
legal notices.

All credits of the API goes to Spotify and their agreements to their respective content-artist agreements.

Any questions that you may have are welcome and I'll try to answer as best as I can regarding the implementation.
